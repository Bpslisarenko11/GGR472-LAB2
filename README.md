# The javascript file, css file, and html file are used to create a webmap

# The javascript file utilizes mapbox styles and tilesets to load the webmap

# The webmap displays polygons of different parks across Toronto, such as High Park, Withrow park, and Christie Pits Park, and these parks are loaded in from mapbox as tileset

# The webamp also displays linestring features from a GeoJSON file loaded into the map. The lines connect the different parks by the streets throughout Torontovto visualize the potential roots to follow to get from park to park
 
# Additionaly the names from the parks are placed as text centered at each park, which was created through the style used for the web map

# Additional GeoJSON point types were created manually for three different parks, riverdale park, Greenwood Park, and Tommy Thompson Park, and these points are in purple.
